# ðŸŽ“ Java OOP Laboratory Activities

   **A showcase of my journey through Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java**

Welcome to my Java OOP Laboratory Activities repository! ðŸš€ This is where I document my growth and exploration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles through hands-on coding exercises and practical implementations. Whether you're a fellow student, developer, or educator, feel free to explore, learn, and even contribute to this repository!



# ðŸŒŸ About This Repository

This repository contains a series of laboratory activities that demonstrate fundamental and advanced OOP principles in Java. Each activity focuses on a specific OOP concept, such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

ðŸ“š **What youâ€™ll find here:**

Well-organized Java programs demonstrating OOP concepts.
Examples of interfaces, inheritance, and class structures.
Hands-on implementations of geometric shapes, collections, and more.
Commented code for better understanding and learning.

# ðŸ’» Activities Included
**ðŸ”¹ Laboratory Activity 1: Input Handling and Comparison**

Understanding user input in Java and simple comparison logic.


**Examples:**
- GettingInputs.java: A program to take user inputs and display them.
- GettingGreater.java: Compares two numbers to find the greater value.



**ðŸ”¹ Laboratory Activity 2: Arrays and Iterations**

Introduction to arrays and loops for performing calculations and creating tables.


**Examples:**
- GetArrayMean.java: Calculates the mean of numbers in an array.
- MultiplicationTable.java: Generates multiplication tables based on user input.



**ðŸ”¹ Laboratory Activity 3: Object-Oriented Programming with Inheritance**
Exploring class hierarchies and inheritance relationships.


**Examples:**
- Artists Project:
- Artist.java, Singer.java, Dancer.java, Painter.java, Writer.java: Represents different types of artists.
- ArtistDemo.java: Driver code for testing.



**ðŸ”¹ Laboratory Activity 4: Abstraction and Interfaces**
Demonstrating interfaces and polymorphism in OOP using geometric shapes.


**Examples:**
- **Shapes Project:**
- Shape.java, Square.java, Rectangle.java, Triangle.java: Implements the Shape interface with methods for area and perimeter.
- ShapeCollection.java: Manages multiple shapes.
- Main.java: Driver code to execute and test the functionality.



**ðŸ”¹ Exercise Sets**

ðŸ”¸ Exercise Set 1: Fundamentals and Practice


**Examples:**
- Welcome.java: Basic print statements for a welcome message.
- Escseq.java: Demonstrates escape sequences in Java strings.
- Tempconvert.java: Converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.


# ðŸŽ‰ Why This Repository?
This repository isnâ€™t just a collection of assignmentsâ€”it's a testament to learning and growth. Through these activities, Iâ€™ve not only honed my Java programming skills but also strengthened my understanding of how OOP principles create scalable and maintainable software.
